= Lab 3 - Operating your Application

[abstract]
--
Pivotal Cloudfoundry makes the work of performing operations actions, such as scaling, doing a zero-downtime deploy, and managing application health very easy.
In the next two labs we'll explore Pivotal Cloudfoundry operations.
--

== Scale the Application Up

. Now let's increase the number of running application instances to 3:
+
----
$ cf scale -i 3 workshop
Scaling app workshop in org TELCO / space zwickey as azwickey@pivotal.io...
OK
----
+
In reporting `OK`, the CLI is letting you know that the additional requested instances have been started, but they are not yet necessarily running.

. We can determine how many instances are actually running like this:
+
====
----
$ cf app workshop
Showing health and status for app workshop in org TELCO / space zwickey as azwickey@pivotal.io...
OK

----
<1> This application instance has completed the startup process and is actually able to accept requests.
<2> This application instance is still starting and will not have any requests routed to it.
====

. Eventually all instances will converge to a running state:
+
----
$ cf app workshop[]

OK

. Revisit the application route in the browser.
Refresh several times.
You should observe the instance index changing as you do so:
+
image::lab.png[]
+
The aforementioned http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router] is applying a random routing algorithm to all of the application instances assigned to this route.
As an instance reaches the `running` state, its http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html[DEA] registers that instance in the routing table assigned to its route by sending a message to Cloud Foundry's message bus.
All (Go)Router instances are subscribed to this channel and register the routes independently.
This makes for very dynamic and rapid reconfiguration!

== Scale the Application Down

. We can scale the application instances back down as easily as we scaled them up, using the same command structure:
+
----
$ cf scale -i 1 workshop
Scaling app workshop in org TELCO / space zwickey as azwickey@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Check the application status again:
+
----
$ cf app workshop
Showing health and status for app workshop in org TELCO / space zwickey as azwickey@pivotal.io...
OK

requested state: started
instances: 1/1
usage: 512M x 1 instances
urls: workshop.vert.fe.gopivotal.com, workshop-queasier-backup.vert.fe.gopivotal.com

     state     since                    cpu    memory           disk           details
#0   running   2015-08-07 11:33:21 AM   0.1%   477.9M of 512M   144.4M of 1G
----
+
As you can see, we're back down to only one instance running, and it is in fact the original index 0 that we started with.

. Confirm that by again revisiting the route in the browser and checking the instance index:

== HTTP Routing

There are two ways to discover what routes, or HTTP URLs, are ampped to an application
The first is available via the CLI. Just type:

----
$ cf app workshop
----

and you'll see the list of routes in the section that says _urls_.

The second way is via the Apps Manager UI.  Click on the _Workshop_ application to view application details.  Select the _Routes_ tab to view a list of mapped routes:

image::lab2.png[]

. We can easily add an additional route by clicking on _+ Map a Route_ and supplying the new hostname:
+
image::lab3.png[]

. Navigate to the new URL in your browser window.  You should see that same application displayed!
+
image::lab4.png[]

. We can just as easily remove a route by clicking on _Unmap_ on the route you wish to remove.
+
image::lab5.png[]
+
If you navigate to that URL you'll receive a HTTP 404 response
+

== Accessing Container Contents

. The contents of a deployed application container may be retrieved using the _files_ command within the CLI.  If the path supplied to the command represents a folder, the contents of the folder are retreived:
